# 1: Command Line Reflection

Write your reflection on a document or by hand on the following questions. Keep track of your answers because you'll be asked to add them to this document in challenge [6: Tracking Changes](../6-tracking-changes).

1. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
2. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
3. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.

-`pwd`

-`ls`

-`grep`

-`mv`

-`cd`

-`../`

-`touch`

-`mkdir`

-`echo`

-`less`

-`rmdir`

-`cat`

-`rm`

-`help`

-`exit`

A1. The materials in this challenge weren’t too difficult for me because I’ve had prior practice with the Terminal CLI. The only two commands I found relatively strange  were echo and grep because I hadn’t been exposed to them previously.

A2. Yes. I’ve read Zed Shaw’s book on Python and he’s instructions are very straightforward.

A3. Let’s see…
- pwd → Stands for print working directory. This commands lets the user know      what directory he/she currently is working in.
- ls  → Stands for list. This command displays the items in the working       directory.
- grep  → Helps narrow the search to certain string or file.
- mv  → Stands for move. User can move files from one directory to another by     implementing the mv command.
- cd  → Change directory. I’ve used this too many times. It helps me jump     from one directory to another.
- ../ → Gets you to (what I’d like to call) the mother directory.
- touch → Creates files.
- mkdir → Literally makes a folder.
- echo  → Command in shell that produces its arguments in standard form
- less  → Provides a page by page display of the content of a file
- rmdir   → Erases a directory/folder.
- cat   → Displays all the content of a file onto the screen.
- rm  →   Removes/erases a chosen file even if it isn’t an empty directory.
- help  →   I learnt man instead. It displays the functionality of a command. For     example man less tells me all about the command less.
- exit  →   Exits the terminal CLI.
